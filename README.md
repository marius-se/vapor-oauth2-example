# VaporOAuth Example Server

This repository contains an example on how to use the VaporOAuth library. It demonstrates the authorization code grant.
Get started by running both, the server app and the client app. The server app will run on port 8090 while the client
app runs on default 8080. To see the app in action navigate to localhost:8090/login.
> `:8090/login` authenticates a user on the server app and redirects you to the client. This way a user will already
be authenticated once we hit the "sign-in with xyz" page.
